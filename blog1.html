    <h1>Understanding Predictive Modeling in Data Science</h1>
    <p>
        Predictive modeling refers to the process of using statistics and machine learning to make predictions 
        about future outcomes based on historical data. It is one of the most essential techniques in data science.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some common predictive models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, 
        gradient boosting, neural networks, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Predictive modeling is widely used in banking, medicine, marketing, fraud detection, and risk analysis.
